## Reverse Vowels of a String

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/

To solve the problem of reversing only the vowels in a given string, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Identify Vowels**: First, identify what constitutes a vowel. For this problem, the vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (both lowercase and uppercase).

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the string and the other from the end. Move these pointers towards each other:
   - The left pointer moves to the right until it finds a vowel.
   - The right pointer moves to the left until it finds a vowel.
   - Swap the vowels at these pointers.

3. **Continue the Process**: Continue the process until the two pointers meet or cross each other.

Here's the Python code to achieve this:

```python
def reverseVowels(s: str) -> str:
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    s = list(s)  # Convert string to list to modify it
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1

    while left < right:
        if s[left] not in vowels:
            left += 1
        elif s[right] not in vowels:
            right -= 1
        else:
            # Swap the vowels
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1

    return ''.join(s)  # Convert list back to string

# Examples to test the function
print(reverseVowels("hello"))  # Output: "holle"
print(reverseVowels("leetcode"))  # Output: "leotcede"
```

### Explanation:
- **Line 1**: Define the function `reverseVowels` which takes a string `s` as input.
- **Line 2**: Create a set of vowels for quick lookup.
- **Line 3**: Convert the string to a list since strings are immutable in Python.
- **Line 4**: Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start and `right` at the end of the list.
- **Lines 6-15**: Loop until the two pointers meet or cross.
- **Lines 7-9**: Move the `left` pointer to the right if the current character is not a vowel.
- **Lines 10-12**: Move the `right` pointer to the left if the current character is not a vowel.
- **Lines 13-15**: If both pointers point to vowels, swap them and move both pointers towards the center.
- **Line 17**: Convert the list back to a string and return it.

This approach ensures that we only traverse the string once, making the solution efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.

## String Compression

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/

Google Gemini answer:

This is a classic in-place modification problem. Since you prefer Python, I'll provide a solution in Python.

The core idea is to use two pointers: one for reading the input array and one for writing to the modified array.

Here's the algorithm:

1.  Initialize `read_ptr` to 0 (the pointer for reading the input array) and `write_ptr` to 0 (the pointer for writing to the modified array).
2.  Iterate with `read_ptr` through the `chars` array.
3.  Inside the loop, for each character `chars[read_ptr]`, count its consecutive occurrences.
4.  Store the character at `chars[write_ptr]` and increment `write_ptr`.
5.  If the count of consecutive occurrences is greater than 1, convert the count to a string, then iterate through its digits. For each digit, store it at `chars[write_ptr]` and increment `write_ptr`.
6.  Update `read_ptr` to the next distinct character's position.
7.  After the loop finishes, `write_ptr` will hold the new length of the compressed array.

Let's break down the counting and writing of the number:

If the count is `12`, you need to write '1' then '2'. A simple way to do this is to convert the count to a string and then iterate through its characters.

Here's the Python code:

```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: list[str]) -> int:
        read_ptr = 0  # Pointer for reading the input array
        write_ptr = 0  # Pointer for writing to the compressed array

        n = len(chars)

        while read_ptr < n:
            current_char = chars[read_ptr]
            count = 0

            # Count consecutive occurrences of current_char
            while read_ptr < n and chars[read_ptr] == current_char:
                count += 1
                read_ptr += 1

            # Write the character
            chars[write_ptr] = current_char
            write_ptr += 1

            # If count is greater than 1, write the count
            if count > 1:
                # Convert count to string and write each digit
                for digit in str(count):
                    chars[write_ptr] = digit
                    write_ptr += 1
        
        return write_ptr

```
