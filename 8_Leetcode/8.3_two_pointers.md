## Reverse Vowels of a String

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/

To solve the problem of reversing only the vowels in a given string, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Identify Vowels**: First, identify what constitutes a vowel. For this problem, the vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (both lowercase and uppercase).

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the string and the other from the end. Move these pointers towards each other:
   - The left pointer moves to the right until it finds a vowel.
   - The right pointer moves to the left until it finds a vowel.
   - Swap the vowels at these pointers.

3. **Continue the Process**: Continue the process until the two pointers meet or cross each other.

Here's the Python code to achieve this:

```python
def reverseVowels(s: str) -> str:
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    s = list(s)  # Convert string to list to modify it
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1

    while left < right:
        if s[left] not in vowels:
            left += 1
        elif s[right] not in vowels:
            right -= 1
        else:
            # Swap the vowels
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1

    return ''.join(s)  # Convert list back to string

# Examples to test the function
print(reverseVowels("hello"))  # Output: "holle"
print(reverseVowels("leetcode"))  # Output: "leotcede"
```

### Explanation:
- **Line 1**: Define the function `reverseVowels` which takes a string `s` as input.
- **Line 2**: Create a set of vowels for quick lookup.
- **Line 3**: Convert the string to a list since strings are immutable in Python.
- **Line 4**: Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start and `right` at the end of the list.
- **Lines 6-15**: Loop until the two pointers meet or cross.
- **Lines 7-9**: Move the `left` pointer to the right if the current character is not a vowel.
- **Lines 10-12**: Move the `right` pointer to the left if the current character is not a vowel.
- **Lines 13-15**: If both pointers point to vowels, swap them and move both pointers towards the center.
- **Line 17**: Convert the list back to a string and return it.

This approach ensures that we only traverse the string once, making the solution efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.

## String Compression

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/

Google Gemini answer:

This is a classic in-place modification problem. Since you prefer Python, I'll provide a solution in Python.

The core idea is to use two pointers: one for reading the input array and one for writing to the modified array.

Here's the algorithm:

1.  Initialize `read_ptr` to 0 (the pointer for reading the input array) and `write_ptr` to 0 (the pointer for writing to the modified array).
2.  Iterate with `read_ptr` through the `chars` array.
3.  Inside the loop, for each character `chars[read_ptr]`, count its consecutive occurrences.
4.  Store the character at `chars[write_ptr]` and increment `write_ptr`.
5.  If the count of consecutive occurrences is greater than 1, convert the count to a string, then iterate through its digits. For each digit, store it at `chars[write_ptr]` and increment `write_ptr`.
6.  Update `read_ptr` to the next distinct character's position.
7.  After the loop finishes, `write_ptr` will hold the new length of the compressed array.

Let's break down the counting and writing of the number:

If the count is `12`, you need to write '1' then '2'. A simple way to do this is to convert the count to a string and then iterate through its characters.

Here's the Python code:

```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: list[str]) -> int:
        read_ptr = 0  # Pointer for reading the input array
        write_ptr = 0  # Pointer for writing to the compressed array

        n = len(chars)

        while read_ptr < n:
            current_char = chars[read_ptr]
            count = 0

            # Count consecutive occurrences of current_char
            while read_ptr < n and chars[read_ptr] == current_char:
                count += 1
                read_ptr += 1

            # Write the character
            chars[write_ptr] = current_char
            write_ptr += 1

            # If count is greater than 1, write the count
            if count > 1:
                # Convert count to string and write each digit
                for digit in str(count):
                    chars[write_ptr] = digit
                    write_ptr += 1
        
        return write_ptr

```

## Move Zeros

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/

Google Gemini answer:

Here's a Python solution for the LeetCode "Move Zeroes" problem:

```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: list[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        
        # Pointer for the position to place the next non-zero element
        non_zero_ptr = 0

        # Iterate through the array with a 'current' pointer
        for current_ptr in range(len(nums)):
            # If the current element is not zero
            if nums[current_ptr] != 0:
                # Place it at the 'non_zero_ptr' position
                nums[non_zero_ptr] = nums[current_ptr]
                # Increment the non_zero_ptr to the next available slot
                non_zero_ptr += 1
        
        # After placing all non-zero elements, fill the remaining positions with zeros
        for i in range(non_zero_ptr, len(nums)):
            nums[i] = 0

```

**Explanation of the approach:**

The solution uses a two-pointer approach, which is a common and efficient technique for in-place array modifications.

1.  **`non_zero_ptr`**: This pointer keeps track of where the next non-zero element should be placed. It starts at the beginning of the array (index 0).
2.  **`current_ptr`**: This pointer iterates through the entire array from left to right.

**How it works:**

* As `current_ptr` iterates, if it encounters a non-zero element (`nums[current_ptr] != 0`), that element is moved to the position indicated by `non_zero_ptr`. Then, `non_zero_ptr` is incremented, effectively preparing for the next non-zero element.
* If `current_ptr` encounters a zero, nothing is done with it in this first pass. The `non_zero_ptr` remains where it is, waiting for the next non-zero number. This implicitly "skips" the zero, effectively moving it to the end.
* After the first loop completes, all non-zero elements will be at the beginning of the array, maintaining their relative order. The `non_zero_ptr` will now point to the first position that should contain a zero.
* The second loop then fills all positions from `non_zero_ptr` to the end of the array with zeros.

**Example walkthrough (nums = [0,1,0,3,12]):**

1.  `nums = [0,1,0,3,12]`, `non_zero_ptr = 0`

2.  `current_ptr = 0`, `nums[0] = 0`. Do nothing.

3.  `current_ptr = 1`, `nums[1] = 1`. Not zero.
    `nums[non_zero_ptr]` (i.e., `nums[0]`) becomes `1`.
    `nums` is now `[1,1,0,3,12]`.
    `non_zero_ptr` becomes `1`.

4.  `current_ptr = 2`, `nums[2] = 0`. Do nothing.

5.  `current_ptr = 3`, `nums[3] = 3`. Not zero.
    `nums[non_zero_ptr]` (i.e., `nums[1]`) becomes `3`.
    `nums` is now `[1,3,0,3,12]`. (Note: the original `1` at `nums[1]` was overwritten, but it was already "processed" by being moved to `nums[0]`).
    `non_zero_ptr` becomes `2`.

6.  `current_ptr = 4`, `nums[4] = 12`. Not zero.
    `nums[non_zero_ptr]` (i.e., `nums[2]`) becomes `12`.
    `nums` is now `[1,3,12,3,12]`.
    `non_zero_ptr` becomes `3`.

7.  End of first loop. `nums` is `[1,3,12,3,12]`, `non_zero_ptr = 3`.

8.  Second loop: `range(non_zero_ptr, len(nums))` which is `range(3, 5)`.
    * `i = 3`: `nums[3] = 0`. `nums` becomes `[1,3,12,0,12]`.
    * `i = 4`: `nums[4] = 0`. `nums` becomes `[1,3,12,0,0]`.

Final `nums`: `[1,3,12,0,0]`

**Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity: $O(N)$**
    * The first loop iterates through the array once.
    * The second loop iterates through the remaining portion of the array.
    * Therefore, the total operations are proportional to the length of the array, `N`.
* **Space Complexity: $O(1)$**
    * The solution modifies the array in-place and does not use any additional data structures that scale with the input size.
